# Created on April 30, 2020 because Ash kept throwing raw numbers and percentages at him
Just a simple comparison tool to visualize the data from Covid-19 Project @ https://covidtracking.com.

To use the tool, just click on the abbreviation for the state or territories you wish to compare. The raw data is automatically updated every day around 4pm Eastern time.

Enjoy!
